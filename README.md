## 🗃️ Dataset

This project uses a custom-labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails for training the classifier.  
The dataset is inspired by and adapted from a **Kaggle competition** and enriched with synthetic examples for better generalization.

> Note: The dataset used for training (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `submission.csv`) is not included in the public repo. You may replace it with your own labeled dataset.
